## About
I live my way from a doctor to a developer.

After working in medicine for some time, I realized that I was most attracted to working with statistics, data and formalized specific results. My practical experience in this field has been limited to working with SPSS and publishing several articles with my research. As a cardiologist, I have gained practical experience in communicating with people (I believe that communicating with sick people has definitely increased my stress tolerance and developed responsibility for the decision). I also have the skills to work in multitasking mode with limited time, and, most importantly, to quickly correct my mistakes. 

I believe that a sincere desire for development and interest in this area will lead me to a result.
